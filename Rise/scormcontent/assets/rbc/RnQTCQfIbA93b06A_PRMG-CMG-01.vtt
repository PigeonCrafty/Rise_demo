00:00:03.700 --> 00:00:06.380
<v ->Projects and change go hand in hand,</v>

2
00:00:06.380 --> 00:00:08.970
but while some changes can help a project

3
00:00:08.970 --> 00:00:11.770
others can send it spiraling off course.

4
00:00:11.770 --> 00:00:14.510
So how can you minimize the risk that come

5
00:00:14.510 --> 00:00:18.380
with change and maximize the rewards?

6
00:00:18.380 --> 00:00:20.500
The answer comes down to implementing

7
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:23.470
and following a change management process.

8
00:00:23.470 --> 00:00:26.010
Which ensures that all revisions are appropriately

9
00:00:26.010 --> 00:00:30.800
defined, analyzed, approved, and resolved.

10
00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:33.300
To follow that process, you'll need to be familiar

11
00:00:33.300 --> 00:00:36.270
with the right documents, roles, and steps

12
00:00:36.270 --> 00:00:38.113
required to implement change.

13
00:00:38.970 --> 00:00:42.600
To start, there are two primary change management documents.

14
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:46.370
First, there's a change request form or CRF.

15
00:00:46.370 --> 00:00:50.810
The CRF explains what the change is, why it's necessary,

16
00:00:50.810 --> 00:00:53.660
and how it will impact the project.

17
00:00:53.660 --> 00:00:56.270
The second document is a change log.

18
00:00:56.270 --> 00:00:58.800
A change log keeps track of every change request

19
00:00:58.800 --> 00:01:01.410
submitted trough a project's history.

20
00:01:01.410 --> 00:01:04.670
It typically includes each change of submission date,

21
00:01:04.670 --> 00:01:07.870
rejection or approval date, requester,

22
00:01:07.870 --> 00:01:10.063
description, and current status.

23
00:01:11.070 --> 00:01:14.250
Now that you're familiar with what those two documents are,

24
00:01:14.250 --> 00:01:17.780
the next question is "Who needs to see them?"

25
00:01:17.780 --> 00:01:20.040
To answer that, you'll need to look at everyone

26
00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.983
who has a role in the change management process.

27
00:01:23.970 --> 00:01:28.200
Normally, there are four primary roles in change management.

28
00:01:28.200 --> 00:01:30.730
The first role is the change requester,

29
00:01:30.730 --> 00:01:33.530
who can be any member of the project team.

30
00:01:33.530 --> 00:01:35.050
This is the person who kicks off

31
00:01:35.050 --> 00:01:37.580
the change management process.

32
00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:41.220
Next, there's you, the project manager.

33
00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:44.690
As a project manager, you'll review all requests,

34
00:01:44.690 --> 00:01:48.820
submit them for approval, participate in implementation,

35
00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:52.073
and record all information in the change log.

36
00:01:53.320 --> 00:01:57.300
Third, there's a change control board or CCB.

37
00:01:57.300 --> 00:02:00.350
This group is the final authority on approval.

38
00:02:00.350 --> 00:02:02.680
For larger projects the CCB might

39
00:02:02.680 --> 00:02:05.710
be referred to as the steering committee.

40
00:02:05.710 --> 00:02:08.400
In smaller organizations the CCB can simply

41
00:02:08.400 --> 00:02:10.813
be a group of dedicated team members.

42
00:02:11.730 --> 00:02:14.560
Finally, you'll also need to include your team

43
00:02:14.560 --> 00:02:16.830
alongside you, your team's responsible

44
00:02:16.830 --> 00:02:19.423
for implementing all approved change requests.

45
00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:22.470
Let's put all of that together.

46
00:02:22.470 --> 00:02:25.110
Remembering those documents and roles, you can apply

47
00:02:25.110 --> 00:02:27.100
change management to your project

48
00:02:27.100 --> 00:02:30.120
by following a four step process.

49
00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:32.220
So what four steps are included

50
00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.850
in that change management process?

51
00:02:34.850 --> 00:02:39.050
The first step involves identifying and submitting a CRF.

52
00:02:39.050 --> 00:02:41.340
The change requester will perform this action

53
00:02:41.340 --> 00:02:45.480
if they discover an unforeseen problem or opportunity.

54
00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.650
Second, as the project manager,

55
00:02:47.650 --> 00:02:49.910
you will review that change request.

56
00:02:49.910 --> 00:02:51.840
During this second step, you'll determine

57
00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:55.100
if more information is needed, whether or not the revision

58
00:02:55.100 --> 00:02:58.480
is necessary for project success, and if the issue can

59
00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:01.423
be resolved without adjusting the project plan.

60
00:03:02.610 --> 00:03:05.630
Next it's time to approve the change request.

61
00:03:05.630 --> 00:03:07.850
If you determine the change is necessary,

62
00:03:07.850 --> 00:03:10.693
you'll forward it to the CCB with a recommendation.

63
00:03:11.770 --> 00:03:14.120
The CCB will then consider the risks of both

64
00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:17.280
implementing and not implementing the change

65
00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:19.523
and they'll make a final approval decision.

66
00:03:20.590 --> 00:03:22.420
Lastly, you'll need to close

67
00:03:22.420 --> 00:03:24.740
and implement the change request.

68
00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:27.740
Regardless of the final decision, close the request

69
00:03:27.740 --> 00:03:30.763
by adding all relevant details to the change log.

70
00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.680
Then, if the request was approved, you and your team

71
00:03:34.680 --> 00:03:37.538
can move forward with implementation.

72
00:03:37.538 --> 00:03:40.120
Implementation requires introducing the revision

73
00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:45.010
to your project plan and performing ongoing quality control.

74
00:03:45.010 --> 00:03:47.690
No project plan is ever perfect.

75
00:03:47.690 --> 00:03:50.230
Conditions, circumstances, and people

76
00:03:50.230 --> 00:03:53.320
will inevitably change and successful projects

77
00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:55.660
will change along them.

78
00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.490
So the next time you're facing something new,

79
00:03:58.490 --> 00:04:01.690
remember to follow the change management process.

80
00:04:01.690 --> 00:04:04.330
That way you can improve your chances of success

81
00:04:04.330 --> 00:04:06.573
and better meet your project goals.
